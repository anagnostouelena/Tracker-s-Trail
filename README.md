# Tracker's Trail

  The current Tracke's Trail project has implemented a VPN connection and utilizes MariaDB for its database management. Features multiple routes that can be created at various points. The project includes teams and judges, with each team possessing a QR code. Judges use an Android app called Scann2Go to scan the QR codes. This allows judges to verify if a team is in the correct position along the specific route assigned to them.
  Additionally, the project incorporates a timing mechanism. Each group will be presented with a series of riddles. The time has taken to solve each puzzle is recorded as teams progress from one puzzle to the next.

Please note that the code for this project is proprietary and cannot be copied.
